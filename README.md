### Hi there, I'm Max 

A few years ago I got into programming by making small Minecraft mods and a Master in CS later that's what I still mostly do on here. I'm proud to have contributed to many other open source projects, like ansible or Nextcloud.

- Working as IT-Security consultant
- Linux enthusiast
- Open source nerd
